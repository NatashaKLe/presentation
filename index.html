          <section>
            In the early days, Charles Babbage had made the device, but he was
            confused about how to give instructions to the machine, and then Ada
            Lovelace wrote the instructions for the analytical engine. The
            device was made by Charles Babbage and the code was written by Ada
            Lovelace for computing Bernoulli’s number. First time in history
            that the capability of computer devices was judged.

            <textarea data-template>
							* It is a type of low-level language.
							* It mainly consists of instructions (kind of symbols) that only machines could understand.
							* In today’s time also assembly language is used in real-time programs such as simulation flight navigation systems and medical equipment eg – Fly-by-wire (FBW) systems.
							* It is also used to
            create computer viruses.</textarea

          <section>1952: Autocode</section>

          <section>
            Developed by Alick Glennie. The first compiled computer programming
            language. COBOL and FORTRAN are the languages referred to as
            Autocode.

          <section>
            Developers are John Backus and IBM. It was designed for numeric
            computation and scientific computing. Software for NASA probes
            voyager-1 (space probe) and voyager-2 (space probe) was originally
            written in FORTRAN 5.

          <section>1958: ALGOL</section>
          <section>
            ALGOL stands for ALGOrithmic Language. The initial phase of the most
            popular programming languages of C, C++, and JAVA. It was also the
            first language implementing the nested function and has a simple
            syntax than FORTRAN. The first programming language to have a code
            block like “begin” that indicates that your program has started and
            “end” means you have ended your code.

            <textarea data-template>
						  The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period. Some notable languages that were developed include: 
						* Logo 
						* Pascal 
						* C
						* Smalltalk</textarea

          <section data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
							The 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation.
							 The reduced instruction set computer (RISC) movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by central processing unit (CPU) speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compiling methods, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compiler technology for high-level languages.
Language technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s.

          <section data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research.
						 Some of the recent trends have included:
						 * Mechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, dependent typing, information flow control, static thread safety.
* Component-oriented software development.
* AOP or Aspect Oriented Programming allowing developers to insert code in another module or class at "join points"
* Domain-specific languages and code generation
* XML for graphical interface (XUL, Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML))
* Increased interest in distribution and mobility.
* Open source as a developmental philosophy for languages, including the GNU Compiler Collection and languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, and Scala.
* Early research in applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to generate code using AI like using GPT-3 and Gemini.</textarea

Many Big Tech companies introduced multiple new programming languages that are designed to serve their needs and provides first-class support for their platforms. for example:
* Microsoft introduced C#, F#, TypeScript, Q#, Bosque and Power Fx.
* Google introduced Go, Dart and Carbon.
* Apple introduced Swift.
* Meta introduced Hack.</textarea
